### Running configuration folder for Bruce
var.xml contains parameterized:
  - IP addresses 
  - network interface names (e.g. AES90)

These should correspond to the IP config of the machine on which the SIPServer is running

See the comments in vars.xml   

Other configuration settings are not server specific, meaning that  
you can port these config files over to other servers providing the IP's are changed
